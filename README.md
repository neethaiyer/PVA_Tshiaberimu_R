These files are needed to run the population viability analysis (PVA):

1. Function Definitions.R

- Do not edit this code if you want the simulations to run without errors!

2. Run Simulations.R
- User will define initial conditions and run the simulations. 
- User will have to choose the appropriate working directories

3. Create Graphs.R
- User will create graphs based on csv files created using "2. Run Simulations.R"
